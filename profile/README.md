## About Electron⚡️Vite

- More often, **Electron⚡️Vite** is doing some experimental features. When the features are stable, they will be ported to [@electron-forge/plugin-vite](https://github.com/electron/forge/tree/main/packages/plugin/vite).
- If you are an Electron developer, I recommend you to use [Electron Forge](https://github.com/electron/forge) because it also supports [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite).
- If you prefer Vite's project structure, then [vite-plugin-electron](https://github.com/electron-vite/vite-plugin-electron) is more suitable for you.
- [vite-plugin-electron-renderer](https://github.com/electron-vite/vite-plugin-electron-renderer), [vite-plugin-electron-preload](https://github.com/electron-vite/vite-plugin-electron-preload) applies to **Electron⚡️Vite** and **Electron Forge**. Due to the nature of Vite, they are currently not perfect and they are experimental plugins. If one day they become perfect, they will also be ported to **Electron Forge**.
